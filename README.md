This is a simple application built using Luminus (A Clojure micro webframework)

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start the application, run:

    lein run

This will start the webserver running the application on Port 3000. 
The application is a simple view that consumes the hot and top json feeds from reddit and presents them to a logged in user.
A user can then choose to "Like" any particular reddit url and can subsequently view their 'likes' in their my-likes page.
